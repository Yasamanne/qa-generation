## QA Generation
This repository contains a project focused on generating Question-Answer (QA) pairs using LLM techniques. The goal of this project is to develop an automated system that can generate high-quality QA pairs from a given pdf input, making it useful for applications such as chatbots, educational tools, and information retrieval systems.


### Project Overview
The QA Generation project leverages natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically create relevant question-answer pairs from text documents. This system is designed to assist in developing educational content, testing systems, or enhancing chatbot capabilities.

### Features
Automated QA Generation: Generate meaningful QA pairs from textual input using pre-trained models.
Customizable Input Text: You can input any passage or text document, and the model will generate appropriate questions and answers.
Scalable for Various Domains: Adaptable for different domains, including education, customer service, and knowledge bases.
